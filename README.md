## Project Objective and Hypothesis  
  
Our objective is to research various payment types, determining which are most popular (credit cards, debit cards, applepay,
googlepay, crypto, etc).  We plan to research various APIs, such as Shopify, Paypal, etc.  Once we determine the top payment types,
we plan to compare them to what banks offer.  We will need to find an API that would show what products banks offer, including payments.
We plan to answer the following questions:  Do banks offer the most popular payment types?  Are they keeping up with technology and
consumer preferences, or are consumers migrating more towards fintech companies who offer these payment technologies?  

Our hypothesis is that banks are not keeping up with changing customer preferences as far as payments, which is why many banks are 
partnering with fintech companies to offer these innovative technologies.
