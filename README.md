## Project Objective and Hypothesis  
  
Our objective is to research news articles using Reuters API to determine the overall sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency in banking.  Given cryptocurrency is creeping into the banking system, we want to determine how the banking industry views cryptocurrency in general.

Our hypothesis is that the banking industry is more risk averse and less supportive of cryptocurrency. While some banks are offering crypto services, we believe that banks are  more comfortable partnering with fintechs to offer crypto services rather than offering them through the bank.

We plan to answer the following questions:  
1. Does the public have a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment surrounding crypto in banking?
2. How are banks incorporating crypto into their business?
3. What are the pros/cons (positive/negative sentiment) regarding crypto in banking?
4. What fintechs are banks partnering with to provide crypto services?

## Datasets Used:
We used data obtained from the Reuters API.
ADD LINK.

1. Bank Use Cases (cattle tracking blockchain, crypto custody services, JP metaverse, Visa/MC offering crypto conversion, TassatPay/Network, USDF Consortium)
2. Risks associated with crypto in banking (BSA/AML, price risk, operational risks, etc)
3. Benefits of crypto in banking (faster payments, regulation/public trust, expansion of bank services/customer base)
